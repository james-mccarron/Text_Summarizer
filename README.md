# Large Language Model Text Summarization

Leveraging the strengths of BERT and Pegasus models, I developed an advanced text summarization system that enhances NLP performance. I streamlined deployment with CI/CD pipelines on AWS, encapsulating the model within Docker containers for consistent operation across various environments. Throughout the project, I adhered to agile methodologies to ensure scalability and incorporated the latest advancements in AI to meet evolving needs.
